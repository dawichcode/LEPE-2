Harvest Taxes and Fees
Description

**Collects taxes and fees, transfers them to the owner wallet, converts SOL to XAUT/P**


#Explanation:

**This script defines three functions:**

1.harvest_taxes_and_fees: Collects taxes and fees, transfers them to the owner wallet, converts SOL to XAUT/PAX, and airdrops 30% of collected taxes to LEPE holders.
2.zfx_schedule: Triggers an automated event via gold weight milestones, compiles holder addresses and balances, mints new tokens, and transfers them to users proportionally.
3.extract_xaut_balance: Extracts XAUT balance, compiles gold weight and price in real-time, and automates the ZFx Schedule.

#Note:

•This script serves as a starting point and requires completion and testing.
•Replace placeholders (e.g., pubkeys, calculations) with actual values.
•Ensure proper error handling and security measures.
